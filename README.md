# Face Detection Attendance System

![Demo](/path/to/demo.gif)

## Overview

The Face Detection Attendance System is a powerful solution that combines K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning with OpenCV to automate attendance tracking. This system simplifies the process of attendance management by recognizing faces in real-time and marking attendance based on facial recognition. Attendance records are securely stored in a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

## Features

- **KNN-Based Face Detection**: Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for precise and efficient face detection.
- **Real-time Attendance Tracking**: Records attendance as individuals' faces are recognized in real-time.
- **Data Storage and Reporting**: Attendance records are stored in a CSV file, allowing for convenient data export and analysis.

# Usage
Ensure the system's camera has access to individuals' faces.
The system will automatically detect and recognize faces, marking attendance accordingly.
Attendance records are securely stored in a CSV file and can be easily exported for further analysis.

# Attendance Records
Attendance records are stored in a CSV file named attendance.csv. You can access and analyze attendance data conveniently using this file. Each row in the CSV file includes the date, time, and the names or IDs of the individuals present.
